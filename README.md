## Introduction 🌟

Welcome to my data visualization project for the Maven Environmental Challenge! In a world where sustainability is paramount, tech giant Apple has embarked on an ambitious mission: to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. As an independent journalist and data visualization enthusiast, I invite you to explore Apple's journey through the lens of data-driven insights and compelling journalism.

### Key Objectives 🎯

- **Visualize Progress**: Track and portray Apple's progress toward carbon neutrality with dynamic visualizations.
- **Highlight Reductions**: Emphasize significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to the 2015 baseline.
- **Journalistic Narrative**: Craft a narrative that immerses the audience in Apple's sustainability journey.
- **Raise Awareness**: Inform and educate a wide audience about corporate sustainability's impact.
- **Inspire Action**: Motivate individuals, businesses, and policymakers to reduce carbon emissions.
- **Transparency**: Ensure data accuracy and transparency to make informed decisions.

## Data Sources 📊

To maintain accuracy, I rely exclusively on official Apple data from their Environmental Progress Reports. Key datasets include:

- [**greenhouse_gas_emissions.csv**](./data/apple_emissions/greenhouse_gas_emissions.csv)
- Carbon Footprint by Product
- Normalizing Factors

## Methodology 🚀

My approach blends data visualization with journalistic storytelling, creating a two-page "newspaper" format that explores Apple's journey toward carbon neutrality from both macro and micro perspectives.

### Key Findings 📈

- Scope Breakdown: Highlighting scope 3 emissions as crucial in addressing environmental impact.
- Product Focus: Emphasizing scope 3 emissions' dominance in the product life cycle.
- Strategic Moves: Analyzing the effects of strategic decisions on emissions and revenue.

## Data Visualizations 📊

Engage with compelling visualizations that tell the story of Apple's carbon neutrality journey:

1. **Emissions Over Time**: A dynamic chart tracing Apple's greenhouse gas emissions from 2015 to 2022.
2. **Scope Breakdown**: Visuals breaking down emissions by scopes for a comprehensive understanding.
3. **Product Life Cycle Impact**: Graphics showcasing the carbon footprint of iPhone models.
4. **Strategic Decisions**: Illustrations of the impact of decisions like charger removal.

## Conclusion 🌱

Apple's path to carbon neutrality is marked by complexity and innovation. Strategic decisions, like charger removal in 2020, can propel the company toward its goal before 2030.

## Future Work 🚧

There's room for deeper analysis, comparative studies, exploration of consumer behavior, policy implications, and stakeholder engagement.

I hope you find this project informative and inspiring. Let's work together for a greener future! 🌍🍏
